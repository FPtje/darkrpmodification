DarkRP modules are a nice and easy way to modify DarkRP. However, they do require some knowledge about Lua.

How to make a DarkRP module
---------------------------------------------------------------------------]]
1. Make a folder in here. Don't give it a crazy name. Make it lowercase, no weird characters and no spaces
2. Make Lua files in it.
	Files that start with sv_ are automatically run by the server
	Files that start with cl_ are automatically run by the client. You don't have to worry about AddCSLuaFile
	Files that start with sh_ are automatically run by the server and the client. You don't have to worry about AddCSLuaFile


Have an example of what a module would look like (from the root of this addon)

lua/
	darkrp_modules/
		better_hud/
			sv_sendtexturefiles.lua
			cl_coolhud.lua
			cl_elements.lua
			cl_doorview.lua


Here's a list of DarkRP functions that you can call in your module:

Here's a list of DarkRP hooks:

Autorefresh and simplerr
---------------------------------------------------------------------------]]
By default there's a mechanism that helps you when there's an error. This mechanism is called "simplerr".
Whenever something goes wrong in your DarkRP module, simplerr will explain the problem as clearly as possible.
This has ONE downside: the error translation comes at the cost of autorefresh. This may be annoying when developing the module.
One can disable simplerr for a single file by putting the following special text in a comment at the top of the file (or anywhere else):

#NoSimplerr#

Note: That includes the two '#' signs. Also, it's case sensitive. Remember the capital N, capital S and the double 'r' in #NoSimplerr#.
Note: It must be in a comment or you'll get a syntax error.

-------------- IMPORTANT --------------
- DO NOT use it if you're not an experienced scripter.
- REMOVE IT when you release your module. That is VERY IMPORTANT!
    Simplerr was made for developers like you, but even moreso for end users.
    If your module has an error, simplerr tells the end user who to report bugs to.
    If your module has any kind of configuration, simplerr will tell people what's wrong when they make mistakes.
        And believe me, they make mistakes A LOT and they DON'T know how to solve them.
- REMOVE IT when you have errors you don't understand. Simplerr will try to explain them the next time they happen.
    This may require a full server restart.
